# 🧭 Task Prioritization – Impact vs. Effort Matrix

Rate each task by **Impact (1–5)** and **Effort (1–5)**.  
Compute **Priority = Impact – Effort** and sort highest first.  
> 🟢 2 or higher → Do this sprint  
> 🟡 0–1 → Optional / Low priority  
> 🔴 Negative → Move to Icebox

## ⚙️ Prioritization Table

| Task | Impact (1–5) | Effort (1–5) | Priority (I–E) | Sprint | Notes |
|------|---------------|---------------|----------------|--------|--------|
| Example: Fix E2E test runner | 5 | 3 | **2** | 12 | High ROI, improves reliability |
| Example: Add screenshots to README | 3 | 1 | **2** | 12 | Quick win for presentation |
| Example: Dockerfile setup | 4 | 4 | **0** | 12 | Moderate effort, plan mid-sprint |
| Example: Excel → SQL Tooling | 4 | 5 | **–1** | Icebox | Good idea but defer for later |

* **Interpretation Guide:**  
  - **Impact:** How valuable or visible the result will be.  
  - **Effort:** Time, complexity, or mental load required.  
  - **Priority:** Higher = Do sooner.
