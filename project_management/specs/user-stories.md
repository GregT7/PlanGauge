# User Story Compendium

## User's Perspective
- As a student user, I want to make realistic plans for completing assignments while in school so that I can lower the number of uncompleted tasks at the end of the week
- As a student user, I want the planning process to take as little time as possible so I have time to do other things
- As a student user, I want the application to look and feel nice to use for an enjoyable experience
- As a student user, I want the application to be convenient to use so I don't get frustrated or stuck doing repetitive tasks
- As a student user, I want to edit acceptable time ranges for weekly tasks so that I have more control over the application
- As a student user, I want the task creation process to be similar to how I use Notion to improve my personal ease of use
- As a student user, I want the application to be responsive so I know if the application is working
- As a student user, I want to easily access stats on previous assignments so I can make informed time estimations manually

## Developer's Perspective
- As a developer, I want to avoid excessive Notion API call's so that I don't get blacklisted from the service
- As a developer, I want to hide my API keys and DB connections to protect my data/account

## Testing Perspective
- As a testing developer, I want to ensure the API call restrictions work so I don't unknowingly or accidentally spam Notion's API
- As a testing developer, I want to test the applications time-sum cards responsiveness to varying event durations to prevent inaccurate calculations and plans
- As a testing developer, I want the entire system to work reliably as intended.
