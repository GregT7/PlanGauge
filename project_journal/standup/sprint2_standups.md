# Sprint 2 Standups
- Dates: Saturday 5/29 - Friday, 6/6

# AI Crutch
**Meeting: June 2, 2025**
**Sprint: Sprint 3**
**Task: Data Entry Table**
### 
## Agenda
### 1. Discuss Progress
- Almost finished a working model of the data entry table but it was all mostly done with ChatGPT and didn't have a strong grasp on the concepts used
- Completed the React course + the two initial backlog items by passing the quizzes (Introduction to Scrum, UI/UX Foundation)
### 2. Discuss issues
- ChatGPT reliance
- Working on things outside of the timeline order due to laziness
- Impulsive/Unfocused work â€“ starting adding new features
### 3. Show DataTable implementation using ChatGPT assistance
### 4. Solutions
- Redo table implementation without any chatgpt assistance
- Start using documentation for Tailwind CSS and Shadcn/UI
### 
## Notes
### 1. Timeline
- Change title of timelines to "Master Schedule"
- Add legends to timeline to label backlog items
- Continue to add green checkmarks and start symbols to the timeline (makes understanding the graph easier)
- Always lead off
### 2. ChatGPT Assistance
- Used generative AI to do most of work creating the working data table component
- Can create projects really fast using ChatGPT
- If there's still time, go back and do everything without AI assistance to build the fundamental skills
- Don't be too reliant on it
### 3. Other
- Don't use TypeScript, use JavaScript instead
- Familiar with JavaScript but not TypeScript
- trying to learn too much and project is taking too long
- There was another shadcn component that I hadn't looked into before that may be a better model for the data table component
- Feedback isn't going to be too specific at this point as technical details are discussed more often
- Information isn't clearly communicated, explanations are too technical and miss the big picture
### 
## Key Decisions
- try not to be too reliant on chatGPT
- use official documentation more (Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/ui, React)
- redo data table without any AI assistance
### 
## Actions
- learn how to use context API
- create two context API components for the 1. (data table, submission button) and 2. (stat card section, plan summary)
