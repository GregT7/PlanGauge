## 🗓️ Standup 2 – Database Redesign + Flask Kickoff

### 🧾 Overview
* **Date:** Thursday, August 21 (2025)
* **Time:** 12:25 PM
* **Attendees:** Solo
* **Discussed Backlog Items:**  
  - Intro to Flask  
  - Database Setup  

### 📋 Contents

#### ✅ Planned Agenda
- Discuss issues with database design and need for redesign
- Emphasize need to work more consistently per day to accomplish sprint tasks

#### 📈 Previous Progress
- Created and finalized functional dependency diagram in BCNF
- Corrected poor database schema design
- Added most recent entries to Excel file

#### 🧱 Problems & Blockers
- Not working enough on project daily
    - No progress on Flask course yesterday
    - Incorrect assumption that schema was already in BCNF
- Supabase design needs a reset
- Database diagrams must be updated

#### ⏳ Pending Actions
- Work on Flask course + draft quiz
- Fix Supabase issues (inserting data + schema redesign)

#### 🔜 Next Steps
- Flask
  - 30 minutes of course
  - Create quiz with 5 questions
- Documentation
  - Add old functional dependency diagram to assets folder
- Database
  - Delete all records in Supabase
  - Populate Categorization table using Excel records
  - Add `cat_reference` values to all other tables in Excel
  - Insert cleaned task records into Supabase

### 🤖 ChatGPT Reflection

#### ❓ Question 1
- **Confidence rating for sprint success based on current progress:**  
  Moderate. Correcting schema design was a big win, but missed work sessions and Flask course delays pose a risk. Staying consistent will be the deciding factor.  

#### ❓ Question 2
- **What feels unclear or risky about today’s tasks?**  
  The redesign work (deleting and repopulating Supabase) is higher risk—could lead to lost data or mismatched references if not carefully executed. Flask quiz creation is lower risk.  

### 🧾 Results

#### 🧠 Discussion Notes
- Fixed major design flaw in database schema by moving to BCNF  
- Recognized work consistency as a key bottleneck for sprint success  
- Flask learning path must resume immediately to stay on schedule  

#### 🗝️ Key Decisions
- Supabase data will be wiped and repopulated cleanly  
- Old functional dependency diagram preserved for documentation  
- Flask quiz creation prioritized alongside schema reset  

#### 📌 Action Items
- Work on Flask course for 30 minutes  
- Draft 5 quiz questions on Flask basics  
- Save old schema diagram in assets folder  
- Delete existing Supabase records  
- Populate Categorization table from Excel  
- Add category references (`cat_reference`) to all tables  
- Insert cleaned task records into Supabase

## 🗓️ Standup 2 – Database Troubles

### 🧾 Overview
* **Date:** Saturday, August 23 (2025)
* **Time:** 1:43 PM
* **Attendees:** Solo
* **Discussed Backlog Items:**  
  - Database Setup
  - Intro to Flask

### 📋 Contents

#### ✅ Planned Agenda
- Encountered more issues with database design but finally fixed it (now in BCNF)
- Still need to work more on the flask solo project
- Not sure if the backend will see any work this sprint

#### 📈 Previous Progress
- Fixed database schema design: went from 2NF to BCNF
- Fixed functional dependency diagram and posted into assets folder
- Wrote + executed SQL code to create corresponding tables

#### 🧱 Problems & Blockers
- Stored data does not match the formatting of the new schema design, will need to refactor stored data
- Not working on backend much
- Haven't really worked on "Backend Setup" backlog

#### ⏳ Pending Actions
- Database Setup

#### 🔜 Next Steps
- Write basic app setup for flask (Backend Setup)
- Reformat stored data to match new schema design without any data integrity violations
- Work on Intro to Flask project for 30 mins

### 🤖 ChatGPT Reflection  

#### ❓ Question 1  
- **What feels unclear or risky about today’s tasks?**  
  Reformatting stored data is the biggest risk—there’s a chance of mismatched references or data loss if done carelessly. Flask setup is lower risk but still requires consistent work sessions.  

#### ❓ Question 2  
- **What am I assuming that might be wrong?**  
  Assuming that the corrected schema will be easy to populate—this might not be true if old data is too messy to map directly. Also assuming backend work can be pushed later without affecting sprint scope, which may not hold if time runs short.  

### 🧾 Results  

#### 🧠 Discussion Notes  
- Database schema issues have been resolved and design is in BCNF  
- Realized data refactoring will take more time than expected  
- Backend setup is lagging behind, but Flask solo project remains a viable entry point  

#### 🗝️ Key Decisions  
- Schema will not be revised further; focus shifts to refactoring data  
- Minimal Flask setup will be attempted this sprint to avoid total backend stagnation  
- Prioritize database integrity over speed when reformatting stored data  

#### 📌 Action Items  
- Reformat existing stored data to match new schema  
- Create a basic Flask app scaffold (Backend Setup)  
- Dedicate at least 30 minutes to the Flask solo project
