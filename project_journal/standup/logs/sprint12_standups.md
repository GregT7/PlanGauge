## 🗓️ Standup 1 – Wrapping Up Sprint 11

### 🧾 Overview
* **Date:** Wednesday, November 5th (2025)
* **Time:** 3:44 PM
* **Attendees:** Self (Solo)
* **Discussed Backlog Items:**  
  - `Deployment`
  - `Security Setup`

### 📋 Contents

#### ✅ Planned Agenda
- Finished sprint 11 & final backlog items, rough project is complete
- Wrap up retrospective for sprint 11
- Start deploying project

#### 📈 Previous Progress
- Completed init_records.sql script for populating database for demo mode
- Finalized readme
- Created `Deployment` and `Security Setup` backlog definition
- Centralized .env file storage and replaced all hard coded urls

#### 🧱 Problems & Blockers
- Sprint 11 documentation is seeping into sprint 12
- Deployment will be vulnerable if security steps aren't taken before making it public
- Don't fully understand the subtasks defined for backend setup for `Deployment`
- Flask dev server is currently going to be served for production which is not ideal

#### ⏳ Pending Actions
- Sprint 11 retrospective

#### 🔜 Next Steps
- Finish sprint 11
  - Retrospective
  - Sprint 11: retro section
- Start `Deployment`
  - Clarify backend subtasks more
  - Install gunicorn + add to requirements.txt
  - Figure out gunicorn launch server

**Answer:**  
You may be assuming that simply running Flask with Gunicorn will be enough for production readiness. In reality, additional steps like configuring environment variables, using proper reverse proxies, and limiting access to demo data are crucial. Another incorrect assumption could be that deployment and security can be treated as sequential rather than integrated steps—security should guide how deployment is set up, not follow it.

### 🧾 Results

#### 🧠 Discussion Notes
- The project has officially reached a functional MVP state aligning with the Minimum Viable Specification (MVS).  
- Deployment preparation marks a transition from development to operational readiness.  
- Noted that backend production setup (Gunicorn + Docker + Fly.io) must be refined to ensure maintainability and security.  
- Security configuration (env variables, demo vs production mode isolation) will directly impact how safe public hosting is.  

#### 🗝️ Key Decisions
- Use **Gunicorn** as the production server for Flask instead of the dev server.  
- Proceed with **Docker + Fly.io** for backend deployment and **Vercel** for frontend.  
- Maintain `.env` separation for demo and production environments.  
- Integrate `Security Setup` backlog tasks *before* exposing endpoints publicly.  

#### 📌 Action Items
- [ ] Complete Sprint 11 retrospective and finalize sprint documentation.  
- [ ] Add `gunicorn` to `requirements.txt` and test local build.  
- [ ] Create `Dockerfile` exposing port 8080 and verify Flask app runs with `gunicorn app:app -b 0.0.0.0:8080`.
