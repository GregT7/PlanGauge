### 🤖 ChatGPT Reflection

#### ❓ Question 1
> How many days do you think it will take to complete Sprint 11? I barely made any progress with E2E testing and finishing the README will take some time as it’s very detail-oriented. Also, I will be spending most of my time on applying to jobs so I won’t be able to dedicate a lot of time per day to this project. Refer to the attached backlog items to get an idea of all the work that needs to be completed.

**Answer:**  
Based on the current workload and reduced daily focus, Sprint 11 should span **7–10 days**.  
- The `End-to-End Testing` backlog involves multiple subtasks (Playwright setup, selectors, accessibility checks, and test server orchestration) that will each require focused but short working sessions.  
- The `Presentation Readiness` backlog (from `pres.md`) will primarily involve finishing documentation (`README`, `sdp.md`, `pop.md`, etc.) and adding evidence/screenshots for completeness.  
A 10-day window allows realistic pacing without burnout or neglecting job applications.

---

#### ❓ Question 2
> Summarize Sprint 10 for me. What were my greatest weaknesses and strengths exemplified through my performance?

**Answer:**  
**Summary:** Sprint 10 marked the transition from heavy development to polish and delivery. Most of the system’s architecture, design documentation, and MVS-level functionality were finalized. However, the sprint was slowed by the detailed nature of final documentation and setup tasks.  

**Strengths:**
- **High documentation quality:** Completed key specs (`reqs.md`, `design.md`, `mvs.md`) with professional formatting and traceable requirements.
- **Testing rigor:** Maintained emphasis on testing readiness, outlining clear E2E criteria in `e2e.md`.
- **Consistency:** Continued Solo-Scrum methodology even during shifting priorities.

**Weaknesses:**
- **Time management:** Overestimated available focus time due to job application workload.
- **E2E implementation delays:** Progress on automated Playwright testing stalled midway due to complexity of concurrent server management and debugging.
- **Sprint boundary awareness:** Some Sprint 10 goals (notably the demo and script automation) rolled over into Sprint 11.

---

### 🧾 Results

#### 🧠 Discussion Notes
- Sprint 11 will emphasize **closure and deliverables** — specifically completing the README, adding missing screenshots/evidence for backlogs, and performing at least one successful end-to-end run.
- Presentation mode setup (`debug=true` in React) will be prioritized to allow quick demo readiness.

#### 🗝️ Key Decisions
- Limit Sprint 11 scope to **final documentation + testing completion**, no new features.
- Maintain lightweight sprints going forward, with shorter daily time allocations.
- Continue using ChatGPT as a reflection and planning tool post-Sprint 11 for project wrap-up review.

## 🗓️ Standup 3 – Progress Consolidation & Readme Updates

### 🧾 Overview
* **Date:** Tuesday, October 21st, 2025  
* **Time:** 6:16 PM  
* **Attendees:** Self (Solo)  
* **Discussed Backlog Items:**  
  - `Presentation Readiness`
  - `End-to-End Testing`

### 📋 Contents

#### ✅ Planned Agenda
- Further updated README & created script aliases for demoing and starting the app with one command.  
- Need to redefine backlog subtasks for `End-to-End Testing`.  
- Need to update README with recent changes.

#### 📈 Previous Progress
- Created two new launch scripts in `package.json`:  
  - `npm run start`: launches both servers and opens the browser for *Full Mode* usage.  
  - `npm run start:demo`: launches both servers and opens the browser for *Demo Mode*, allowing users to explore a functional version of the project without requiring setup.  
- Finished an outdated draft of the README that now needs revisions to reflect recent architecture and feature changes.

#### 🧱 Problems & Blockers
- When downloading the project, asset files take up significant memory and are unnecessary for users simply testing the demo version.  
  - These assets remain on GitHub for documentation purposes (tracking progress across sprint cycles).  

#### ⏳ Pending Actions
- Continue improving README.  
- Update `End-to-End Testing` subtasks and associated Definition of Done (DoD).  

#### 🔜 Next Steps
- **Update README:**
  - Resize the system architecture diagram.  
  - Add a short overview for the Use Case section, moving existing content into a toggle.  
  - Add a Dependencies section.  
  - Revise “How to Use Tool” section:
    - Add detailed explanations for *Demo Mode* and *Full Mode*.  
    - Simplify demo setup steps.  
    - Clarify full mode installation and API integration steps.  
    - Place current detailed instructions in collapsible toggles.  

- **Update `End-to-End Testing`:**
  - Redefine subtasks for Playwright coverage.  
  - Update DoD to include test completeness and trace/screenshot verification.  

### 🤖 ChatGPT Reflection

#### ❓ Question 1
**What are the biggest risks in today’s tasks? What assumptions am I making that may be incorrect?**  
- The biggest risk is over-prioritizing documentation refinement over practical testing progress. I’m assuming all current test cases will integrate smoothly with the new dual-mode launch scripts, but environment variable handling between *demo* and *full* modes could create inconsistent test outcomes if not mocked correctly.

#### ❓ Question 2
**Is my approach truly Agile, or is it more reminiscent of waterfall or another methodology?**  
- It’s still mostly Agile (iterative cycles, incremental improvements, reflection), but the documentation-heavy phase feels more like a brief Waterfall interlude — focused on stabilizing and finalizing deliverables before new iterations of functionality.  

### 🧾 Results

#### 🧠 Discussion Notes
- Creating demo launch scripts increased accessibility for reviewers and simplified showcasing the system.  
- README refinement will directly improve project presentation and reduce onboarding friction for future users or recruiters.

#### 🗝️ Key Decisions

### 🤖 ChatGPT Reflection

#### ❓ Question 1  
**If you had to create a system for prioritizing new tasks to add to this project, what would you create?**  
I would create a lightweight **priority matrix** that ranks new tasks by *impact vs. effort*. High-impact and low-effort tasks (e.g., documentation clarity, test coverage) would take priority. Tasks with high effort but low immediate impact would be deferred to post-presentation cleanup. This structure would ensure progress aligns with both presentation goals and technical stability.

#### ❓ Question 2  
**What am I assuming that may be incorrect?**  
I may be assuming that the E2E build issues stem entirely from the Vite configuration rather than from cross-environment inconsistencies in the Playwright test runner. It’s possible the issue lies in the output directory mapping or test environment setup rather than the build process itself. Testing a manual static server launch before debugging the build script could confirm this.

### 🧾 Results

#### 🧠 Discussion Notes
- Recognized the need for clearer task prioritization to prevent burnout during final testing.
- Identified that some E2E failures are environment-related rather than due to component logic.
- Noted the benefit of temporarily simplifying the build flow to isolate core test failures.

#### 🗝️ Key Decisions
- Adopt a two-tier test launch approach: first confirm static server accessibility, then automate with Playwright.
- Finalize backlog documentation before continuing test automation to maintain accurate project state.

#### 📌 Action Items
- [x] Update `End-to-End Testing`
  - [x] Redefine subtasks for Playwright coverage.  
  - [x] Update DoD to include test completeness and trace/screenshot verification.  
- [x] Update `Presentation Readiness`
  - [x] Move assets to google drive

## 🗓️ Standup 5 – E2E Test Writing part 1

### 🧾 Overview
* **Date:** Thursday, October 23th (2025)
* **Time:** 12:29 PM
* **Attendees:** Greg T.
* **Discussed Backlog Items:**  
  - `Presentation Readiness`
  - `End-to-End Testing`

---

### 📋 Contents

#### ✅ Planned Agenda
- Got a basic testing boot script (builds frontend, launches servers, and starts e2e tests)
- Finally ready to work on writing end-to-end tests

#### 📈 Previous Progress
- Figured out how to build and access app
- Got basic `test-boot.js` script to work
- Updated `Presentation Readiness` and `End-to-End Testing`

#### 🧱 Problems & Blockers
- Moving assets folder to Google Drive could complicate the merge process
- `.env` file placement is confusing and not sure if all variables are being used
- Newly created scripts sometimes use hard-coded values instead of `.env` variables
- E2E test coverage doesn’t include retrieving actual stats data — only interfaces with static demo API

#### ⏳ Pending Actions
- None at the moment

#### 🔜 Next Steps
- Write E2E tests:
  - Cold launch → stats render  
  - Enter tasks → per-day totals & summary  
  - Verify footer SUM updates dynamically

### 🤖 ChatGPT Reflection

#### ❓ Question 1
**What assumptions am I making that may be incorrect? What dependencies am I missing?**  
- Assuming that the `vite preview` server starts immediately after build completion — in practice, it takes a few seconds, which can cause race conditions if the tests begin too early.  
- Assuming all `.env` variables are correctly loaded for both Flask and Vite; they might not be when using `spawn`.  
- Missing a dependency between the backend mock route setup and the frontend waiting logic in `test-boot.js`.

#### ❓ Question 2
**What's a SMALL change that would be EASY for me to implement today that could improve my approach?**  
- Add a short delay (e.g., `setTimeout`) or use a `wait-on` check for the preview URL before starting Playwright tests.  
- Replace hard-coded URLs in `test-boot.js` with `process.env.BASE_URL` and `process.env.API_URL`.  
- Add a visible test-only “demo mode” badge to differentiate real vs mock routes during test runs.

### 🧾 Results

#### 🧠 Discussion Notes
- Focus shifted from backend data integration to ensuring the frontend and backend both launch deterministically in test mode.  
- Realized that modularizing the orchestration logic will simplify test writing — e.g., separating build, launch, and teardown into helper functions.  
- Confirmed that core E2E coverage should validate UI flow correctness (header load, stat render, user task input, total recalculation).  

#### 🗝️ Key Decisions
- Move assets to Google Drive **after** the pull request is finalized to avoid merge conflicts.  
- Keep E2E tests demo-based for now (mocked static data).  
- Postpone testing of live database/API stats retrieval until after presentation readiness.  
- Add `.env.demo` to explicitly separate demo/test credentials.  
- Will use Playwright’s `trace:on` for debugging failed tests.

#### 📌 Action Items
- [ ] Write E2E tests:
  - [ ] Cold launch → stats render  
  - [ ] Enter tasks → per-day totals & summary  
  - [ ] Verify footer SUM updates dynamically
- [ ] Write out desired .env placement structure
