---

## 🗓️ Standup 1 – Getting Started Up Again

### 🧾 Overview
* **Date:** Friday, October 17th (2025)
* **Time:** 1:46 PM
* **Attendees:** Self (Solo)
* **Discussed Backlog Items:**  
  - `Presentation Readiness`
  - `End-to-End Testing`

---

### 📋 Contents

#### ✅ Planned Agenda
- Transitioning focus toward job applications but still want to push to finalize the project.
- Sprint 10 is over — need to plan Sprint 11 realistically with reduced available time.
- Focus for the next sprint will be on completing documentation and final end-to-end (E2E) testing setup.

#### 📈 Previous Progress
- Finalized documentation of major project management artifacts:
  - `user-stories.md`, `mvs.md`, `design.md`, `reqs.md`, `pop.md`, `sdp.md`
- Made strong progress on the `README` file:
  - Added title and description
  - Implemented collapsible table of contents
  - Expanded “Overview” section to include descriptions, testing coverage, and updated architecture diagram

#### 🧱 Problems & Blockers
- Sprint 10 ended without fully completing the E2E testing setup or demo preparation.
- Need to define and plan Sprint 11 with realistic expectations given job application priorities.
- Balancing time between portfolio work and active job search is now a key constraint.

#### ⏳ Pending Actions
- Complete `README.md`
- Finalize and test the launch script for end-to-end testing (`test-boot.js`)

#### 🔜 Next Steps
- Wrap up remaining Sprint 10 deliverables:
  - Write Sprint 10 retrospective (`sprint10.md`)
- Begin Sprint 11 planning and documentation:
  - Define sprint goals and estimated duration
  - Add `sprint11.md` based on `sprint_template.md`
- Run final debugging on the Playwright configuration and test server script.

### 🤖 ChatGPT Reflection

#### ❓ Question 1
> How many days do you think it will take to complete Sprint 11? I barely made any progress with E2E testing and finishing the README will take some time as it’s very detail-oriented. Also, I will be spending most of my time on applying to jobs so I won’t be able to dedicate a lot of time per day to this project. Refer to the attached backlog items to get an idea of all the work that needs to be completed.

**Answer:**  
Based on the current workload and reduced daily focus, Sprint 11 should span **7–10 days**.  
- The `End-to-End Testing` backlog involves multiple subtasks (Playwright setup, selectors, accessibility checks, and test server orchestration) that will each require focused but short working sessions.  
- The `Presentation Readiness` backlog (from `pres.md`) will primarily involve finishing documentation (`README`, `sdp.md`, `pop.md`, etc.) and adding evidence/screenshots for completeness.  
A 10-day window allows realistic pacing without burnout or neglecting job applications.

#### ❓ Question 2
> Summarize Sprint 10 for me. What were my greatest weaknesses and strengths exemplified through my performance?

**Answer:**  
**Summary:** Sprint 10 marked the transition from heavy development to polish and delivery. Most of the system’s architecture, design documentation, and MVS-level functionality were finalized. However, the sprint was slowed by the detailed nature of final documentation and setup tasks.  

**Strengths:**
- **High documentation quality:** Completed key specs (`reqs.md`, `design.md`, `mvs.md`) with professional formatting and traceable requirements.
- **Testing rigor:** Maintained emphasis on testing readiness, outlining clear E2E criteria in `e2e.md`.
- **Consistency:** Continued Solo-Scrum methodology even during shifting priorities.

**Weaknesses:**
- **Time management:** Overestimated available focus time due to job application workload.
- **E2E implementation delays:** Progress on automated Playwright testing stalled midway due to complexity of concurrent server management and debugging.
- **Sprint boundary awareness:** Some Sprint 10 goals (notably the demo and script automation) rolled over into Sprint 11.

---

### 🧾 Results

#### 🧠 Discussion Notes
- Sprint 11 will emphasize **closure and deliverables** — specifically completing the README, adding missing screenshots/evidence for backlogs, and performing at least one successful end-to-end run.
- Presentation mode setup (`debug=true` in React) will be prioritized to allow quick demo readiness.

#### 🗝️ Key Decisions
- Limit Sprint 11 scope to **final documentation + testing completion**, no new features.
- Maintain lightweight sprints going forward, with shorter daily time allocations.
- Continue using ChatGPT as a reflection and planning tool post-Sprint 11 for project wrap-up review.

#### 📌 Action Items
- [x] Wrap up remaining Sprint 10 deliverables:
  - [x] Write Sprint 10 retrospective (`sprint10.md`)
  - [x] Update sprint10.md
- [x] Begin Sprint 11 planning and documentation:

## 🗓️ Standup 2 – Install & Run

### 🧾 Overview
* **Date:** Saturday, October 18th (2025)
* **Time:** 11:42 AM
* **Attendees:** Self (Solo)
* **Discussed Backlog Items:**  
  - `Presentation Readiness`

### 📋 Contents

#### ✅ Planned Agenda
- Finished sprint 10 and started sprint 11  
- Want to continue working on README

#### 📈 Previous Progress
- Sprint 10 documentation completed: `sprint10.md` + `sprint10_retro.md`  
- Sprint 11 documentation draft: `sprint11.md`  
- Continued working on README  
  - Created a demo  
  - Finished **Project Structure** section describing each folder and its contents

#### 🧱 Problems & Blockers
- Need to install the project on Raspberry Pi to confirm it runs properly  
- Unsure if the installation tutorial covers every dependency and setup step  

#### ⏳ Pending Actions
- Continue writing and refining the README  

#### 🔜 Next Steps
- Expand the README sections:  
  - How to install  
  - How to use the tool  
  - How to run tests  
  - Limitations  
  - Acknowledgements  

### 🤖 ChatGPT Reflection

#### ❓ Question 1
- **What is most risky about today's tasks?**  
  The Raspberry Pi installation process — platform-specific dependency issues may arise, especially with Node or Python versions.

#### ❓ Question 2
- **What assumptions am I making that may be incorrect?**  
  Assuming the current README installation steps are complete without having tested them on a clean environment yet.

### 🧾 Results

#### 🧠 Discussion Notes
- Installation verification on Raspberry Pi is essential before finalizing the README setup tutorial.  
- Testing cross-platform compatibility will improve the documentation’s completeness and credibility for presentation.  

#### 🗝️ Key Decisions
- Postpone polishing of non-essential README sections until installation testing confirms that the project runs end-to-end.  

#### 📌 Action Items
- [ ] Test installation on Raspberry Pi
- [ ] Work on Readme
  - [ ] Installation tutorial draft
  - [ ] How to use tool draft
  - [ ] How to run tests
