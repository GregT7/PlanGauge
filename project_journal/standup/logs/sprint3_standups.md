* **Time:** ...  
* **Attendees:** Dad (Project Manager)  
* **Discussed Backlog Items:**

### 📋 Contents

#### ✅ Planned Agenda
1. **Discuss Progress**
   - Almost finished a working model of the data entry table but it was mostly done with ChatGPT.
   - Completed the React course + two backlog items (Intro to Scrum, UI/UX Foundation).
2. **Discuss Issues**
   - ChatGPT reliance  
   - Worked out of order due to laziness  
   - Impulsive/unfocused work — started new features
3. **Showcase**
   - Demo of DataTable implemented using ChatGPT
4. **Proposed Solutions**
   - Redo the data table implementation without ChatGPT  
   - Rely more on official documentation (Tailwind, Shadcn/UI)

#### 🧠 Discussion Notes
1. **Timeline**
   - Rename timeline to “Master Schedule”
   - Add legends to label backlog items
   - Continue using checkmarks/stars for visual clarity
   - Always lead off with timeline
2. **ChatGPT Assistance**
   - Most work was AI-generated
   - Great for speed, bad for deep understanding
   - Goal: redo with no assistance to build skills
3. **Other**
   - Avoid TypeScript for now (too much cognitive load)
   - Explore alternate Shadcn components for the table
   - Technical details are dominating—focus on communication clarity

### 🧾 Results

#### 🗝️ Key Decisions
- Don’t rely too much on ChatGPT
- Use official documentation more
- Redo the table without AI
