## üóìÔ∏è Standup 1 - AI Crutch

### Overview
* Date: June 2, 2025
* Time: ...
* Attendees: Dad (Project Manager)
* Discussed Backlog Items:
  * Data Entry Table

### Contents
#### Planned Agenda:
1. Discuss Progress
    1. Almost finished a working model of the data entry table but it was all mostly done with ChatGPT and didn't have a strong grasp on the concepts used
    2. Completed the React course + the two initial backlog items by passing the quizzes (Introduction to Scrum, UI/UX Foundation)
2. Discuss issues
    1. ChatGPT reliance
    2. Working on things outside of the timeline order due to laziness
    3. Impulsive/Unfocused work ‚Äì starting adding new features
3. Show DataTable implementation using ChatGPT assistance
4. Solutions
    1. Redo table implementation without any chatgpt assistance
    2. Start using documentation for Tailwind CSS and Shadcn/UI

#### Discussion Notes:
1. Timeline
    1. Change title of timelines to "Master Schedule"
    2. Add legends to timeline to label backlog items
    3. Continue to add green checkmarks and start symbols to the timeline (makes understanding the graph easier)
    4. Always lead off
2. ChatGPT Assistance
    1. Used generative AI to do most of work creating the working data table component
    2. Can create projects really fast using ChatGPT
    3. If there's still time, go back and do everything without AI assistance to build the fundamental skills
    4. Don't be too reliant on it
3. Other
    1. Don't use TypeScript, use JavaScript instead
        1. Familiar with JavaScript but not TypeScript
        2. trying to learn too much and project is taking too long
    2. There was another shadcn component that I hadn't looked into before that may be a better model for the data table component
    3. Feedback isn't going to be too specific at this point as technical details are discussed more often
    4. Information isn't clearly communicated, explanations are too technical and miss the big picture

### Results
#### Key Decisions:
    1. try not to be too reliant on chatGPT
    2. use official documentation more (Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/ui, React)
    3. redo data table without any AI assistance
#### Action Items:
    1. learn how to use context API
    2. create two context API components for the 1. (data table, submission button) and 2. (stat card section, plan summary)
