### 📋 Contents

#### ✅ Planned Agenda
- Complete and document Sprint 4 retrospective + standup
- Try using ChatGPT’s standup reflection questions
- Continue unit testing (remaining 6 components)
- Begin planning for integration testing (`TaskTable`)

#### 📈 Previous Progress
- Documented ChatGPT’s standup improvement suggestions
- Completed unit testing for 2 of 8 components
  - Simulated props and user interaction
  - Complex components handled first
  - Remaining components are expected to be easier
- Noted that integration testing for the data table will likely require a full day

#### 🧱 Problems & Blockers
- Standups not happening daily
- Doubts about whether daily standups are warranted due to perceived low productivity
- Adapting to JavaScript is still ongoing
- Writing retrospectives and standups is time-consuming
- General feeling of slow progress
- Only completed one backlog item during Sprint 4

#### ⏳ Pending Actions
- Continue unit testing (6 more components remaining)
- Finish writing unit test for `DateSelector.jsx`
- Complete Sprint 4 retrospective
- Update and publish related documentation

#### 🔜 Next Steps
- Complete and document Sprint 4 retrospective
- Update sprint_dashboard and publish Sprint 4 docs
- Finalize this standup and generate `.md` version
- Finish `DateSelector.jsx` unit test

### 🤖 ChatGPT Reflection

#### ❓ Are the next step tasks small enough to complete today?
✅ Yes. All listed tasks are achievable in one focused session:
- Retrospective + doc: ~30–90 minutes
- Standup doc: already underway
- Unit test for `DateSelector`: scoped and manageable
- Sprint 4 doc updates: feasible if limited in scope

#### ❓ What am I assuming that might be wrong?
- That minor progress doesn’t merit daily standups — even small progress is worth logging
- That standups and retrospectives must be long to be useful
- That documentation always needs high polish before it's valuable

#### ❓ What feels unclear or risky about today's tasks?
- Integration testing for `TaskTable.jsx` is a known time sink
- Testing UI behaviors like popovers and dropdowns could get tricky
- Unsure whether current workflow is sustainable if every standup needs full markdown generation

### 🧾 Results

#### 🧠 Discussion Notes
- Standups are effective, but process felt tedious with double formatting
- ChatGPT suggested a unified template combining both personal and GitHub-ready formats
- Clarified use cases for full vs. summary standup logs in the repo
- Explored but ultimately deprioritized automation (e.g. Zapier, Notion API)
- Time tracking shows ~2× faster output using optimized flow

#### 🗝️ Key Decisions
- ✅ Adopt a **new standup workflow**:
  1. Fill out Overview, Contents, and ChatGPT sections
  2. Paste into ChatGPT for feedback
  3. Document Key Decisions and Actions
  4. Ask ChatGPT to generate final `.md` file
  5. Review and upload to GitHub

- ✅ Keep **long-form standup files** in GitHub repo

- ✅ Create a **`/digests` directory** for summarized standup reviews (Agenda, Notes, Decisions, Actions)

- ✅ At project end:
  - Ask ChatGPT to batch-convert long-form standups into digest format
  - Upload both formats for archival and presentation purposes

- ✅ Skip Notion automation tools — copy/paste `.md` into Notion manually (takes <5s)
