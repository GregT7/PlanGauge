## 🗓️ Standup 1 – Completing Rollover Items

### 🧾 Overview
* **Date:** May 19, 2025
* **Time:** ... 
* **Attendees:** Dad, Mom
* **Discussed Backlog Items:**  
  - UI/UX Foundation
  - Introduction to Solo-scrum

### 📋 Contents

#### ✅ Planned Agenda
- Discuss small logistical progress I made yesterday and what I intend on finishing by the end of today

#### 🧠 Discussion Notes
1. Gave sprint 1 review presentation
2. Discussed yesterdays progress: formatted and uploaded documentation for sprint 1 to GitHub + finished the sprint review presentation
3. Introduced problems with creating timeline: only have 4 out of the 12 backlog items fully defined including all subtasks, additionally it took me around 30 mins to complete the subtask definition for 1 new backlog item, it will take a long time to complete a fully fleshed out timeline draft, also the project will evolve and subtasks and maybe even backlog items will change
4. Decided to create a rough timeline for just the backlog items including my trip to Japan
5. Also decided to only fill out the subtask items for each backlog item in the current sprint and the next sprint
6. Requested rough timeline and the short but detailed timeline be introduced in the next standup to better visualize my progress

### 🧾 Results

#### 🗝️ Key Decisions
1. Create rough timeline based on just the backlog items, include in standup ppx
2. Create more detailed timeline for the immediate future, include in standup ppx
3. Fill out subtasks for the current and next sprint backlog items

#### 📌 Action Items
- Create rough timeline including Japan
- Give sprint 1 presentation later on today
- Complete and grade 1st and 2nd quiz
- Fix figma ui mockup
- Version 1: make consistent + download (extra version)
- Version 2: make consistent + remove status bar + download (mvs version ---- remove impulsive feature)

## 🗓️ Standup 3 – Static UI Implementation

### 🧾 Overview
* **Date:** May 21, 2025
* **Time:** ...
* **Attendees:** Dad, Mom
* **Discussed Backlog Items:**  
  - UI/UX Foundation

### 📋 Contents

#### ✅ Planned Agenda
- Discuss timelines created (rough/comprehensive timeline + immediate/detailed timeline)
- Finally trying to implement the static ui elements to web page (actually coding)
- Evaluate merit of "vibe coding" and explore steps to take to learn content more rigorously
- Introduce the newly added table to the React app
- Debate feasibility of timeline in conjunction with Japan trip

#### 🧠 Discussion Notes
- The immediate timeline is not realistic
- Relying too much on ChatGPT to direct this project and write code
- Not following the timeline I created -- completing tasks in incorrect order
- Need more time to understand and write code myself
- Should probably cancel Japan trip and put more time into this project
- The annotated timeline that included indicators of what has been completed and what is being worked on for the immediate timeline is useful and should be done every standup

### 🧾 Results

#### 🗝️ Key Decisions
- Consider not going on Japan trip, reprioritize this project so I can understand what I am writing and focus on my career
- Taking 4 months off with no school or job is too long
- Expand timeline so that I have time to learn and write the code myself
- Include annotated version of the immediate timeline every standup

#### 📌 Action Items
1. Add stat cards
2. Add feedback section
3. Add submit button
