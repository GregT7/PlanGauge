# 📅 Sprint #10 – Finishing Up
* **Dates:** October 2nd (2025) - October 13th (2025)

---

### 📋 Contents

#### ✅ Planned Agenda
- Update backlog documentation
- Continue implementing `EvaluationSection` (almost done)
- Keep October 13th deadline in mind when writing backlogs

#### 📈 Previous Progress
- Finished sprint 9 documentation
- Set up sprint 10 documentation

#### 🧱 Problems & Blockers
- Many frontend tests failing due to recent changes → needs fixes
- `ProcessingContext` currently does not provide all info needed for `EvaluationSection`

#### ⏳ Pending Actions
- Finish sprint 10 planning
- Complete `EvaluationSection` from **Feedback System** and update `ProcessingContext`

#### 🔜 Next Steps
- Update backlog documentation:
  - `Feedback System`
  - `End-to-End Testing`
  - `Presentation Readiness`
- EvaluationSection
  - Update ProcessingContext with necessary information
  - Implement subcomponents (accordions for hiding info + stat card for background)
- If time permits, resolve 1 failing test case

### 🤖 ChatGPT Reflection

#### ❓ Q1. Do you think I can finish all three backlog items in 11 days?  
- Likely yes, but only if you (1) scope test coverage tightly, (2) document at a minimal but sufficient level, and (3) don’t over-engineer diagrams/features.

#### ❓ Q2. What assumptions might be incorrect? Any missing dependencies?  
- Assumption: `ProcessingContext` changes will be quick → may take longer since EvaluationSection requires specific data shapes.  
- Dependency gap: frontend test suite needs stabilization before presentation prep (otherwise, failing tests will block readiness).

### 🧾 Results

#### 🧠 Discussion Notes
- Finish `EvaluationSection` before refining backlog docs to avoid double work
- Prioritize bug fixes over adding new test cases until core is stable

#### 🗝️ Key Decisions
- Scope for backlog documentation updates = **minimum detail needed for Sprint 10 + presentation**
- Do not expand testing framework choice yet (leave as TBD in backlog)

#### 📌 Action Items
- [ ] Update backlog documentation:
  - [ ] `Feedback System`
  - [ ] `End-to-End Testing`
  - [ ] `Presentation Readiness`
- [ ] EvaluationSection
  - [ ] Update ProcessingContext with necessary information
  - [ ] Implement subcomponents (accordions for hiding info + stat card for background)
