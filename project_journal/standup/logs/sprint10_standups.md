# 📅 Sprint #10 – Finishing Up
* **Dates:** October 2nd (2025) - October 13th (2025)

---

### 📋 Contents

#### ✅ Planned Agenda
- Update backlog documentation
- Continue implementing `EvaluationSection` (almost done)
- Keep October 13th deadline in mind when writing backlogs

#### 📈 Previous Progress
- Finished sprint 9 documentation
- Set up sprint 10 documentation

#### 🧱 Problems & Blockers
- Many frontend tests failing due to recent changes → needs fixes
- `ProcessingContext` currently does not provide all info needed for `EvaluationSection`

#### ⏳ Pending Actions
- Finish sprint 10 planning
- Complete `EvaluationSection` from **Feedback System** and update `ProcessingContext`

#### 🔜 Next Steps
- Update backlog documentation:
  - `Feedback System`
  - `End-to-End Testing`
  - `Presentation Readiness`
- EvaluationSection
  - Update ProcessingContext with necessary information
  - Implement subcomponents (accordions for hiding info + stat card for background)
- If time permits, resolve 1 failing test case

### 🤖 ChatGPT Reflection

#### ❓ Q1. Do you think I can finish all three backlog items in 11 days?  
- Likely yes, but only if you (1) scope test coverage tightly, (2) document at a minimal but sufficient level, and (3) don’t over-engineer diagrams/features.

#### ❓ Q2. What assumptions might be incorrect? Any missing dependencies?  
- Assumption: `ProcessingContext` changes will be quick → may take longer since EvaluationSection requires specific data shapes.  
- Dependency gap: frontend test suite needs stabilization before presentation prep (otherwise, failing tests will block readiness).

### 🧾 Results

#### 🧠 Discussion Notes
- Finish `EvaluationSection` before refining backlog docs to avoid double work
- Prioritize bug fixes over adding new test cases until core is stable

#### 🗝️ Key Decisions
- Scope for backlog documentation updates = **minimum detail needed for Sprint 10 + presentation**
- Do not expand testing framework choice yet (leave as TBD in backlog)

#### 📌 Action Items
- [x] Update backlog documentation:
  - [x] `Feedback System`
  - [x] `End-to-End Testing`
  - [x] `Presentation Readiness`
- [ ] EvaluationSection
  - [ ] Update ProcessingContext with necessary information
  - [ ] Implement subcomponents (accordions for hiding info + stat card for background)
- [ ] If time permits, resolve 1 failing test case

## 🗓️ Standup 2 – Halfway Through `Feedback System`

### 🧾 Overview
* **Date:** Saturday, October 4th (2025)
* **Time:** 10:20 AM
* **Attendees:** Self (Solo)
* **Discussed Backlog Items:**  
  - `Feedback System`
  - `End-to-End Testing`
  - `Presentation Readiness`

### 📋 Contents

#### ✅ Planned Agenda
- Almost done implementing `Feedback System` draft (without any testing done)
- Completed drafts for `End-to-End Testing` and `Presentation Readiness`
- It's probably going to take me a lot longer to finish everything & there may be issues with scope creep

#### 📈 Previous Progress
- Completed drafts for `Feedback System`, `End-to-End Testing`, and `Presentation Readiness`
- Completed around 75% of EvaluationSection for `Feedback System`
  - Finished ProcessingContext draft
  - Decided on design
  - Implemented 2 info accordions
  - Have 2 info accordions left to implement

#### 🧱 Problems & Blockers
- There may be issues with scope creep for `End-to-End Testing` (introducing CI elements)
  - But this will enhance my resume if I complete it
- Will probably take me an additional sprint to complete the three remaining backlog items
- Still haven't done any testing
- Issues with default/unknown status shading logic

#### ⏳ Pending Actions
- Implement the EvaluationSection for the `Feedback System`

#### 🔜 Next Steps
- Finish the EvaluationSection.jsx component
  - Week Score Accordion
  - Daily Score Accordion
    - Update evalFeasibility: needs to evaluate daily feasibility instead of just score, also needs to return this info
- Implement status shading for all the other subcomponents
- Start resolving regression tests (try for 5)

### 🤖 ChatGPT Reflection

#### ❓ Question 1  
**Can I complete all three backlog items in 9 days?**  
> Yes — 9 days is a realistic timeframe **if you maintain focus and structure your workflow by priority**.  
> - **Days 1–4:** Finalize the `Feedback System` — finish the `EvaluationSection`, verify feasibility calculations, and complete regression tests.  
> - **Days 5–7:** Implement `End-to-End Testing` using Playwright/Vitest; prioritize basic user flow tests before adding CI integrations.  
> - **Days 8–9:** Complete `Presentation Readiness` — finalize documentation, DoD verification, and polish visuals for the demo.  
>  
> This timeline assumes no major architectural refactors are needed and that you allocate at least one buffer day for bug fixes or regressions.  
> In summary: **achievable but requires strict timeboxing and avoiding additional features outside the original MVS scope.**


#### ❓ Question 2  
**What assumptions may be incorrect? What are today’s biggest risks?**  
> - Assuming no major refactor will be needed once feasibility evaluation logic expands.  
> - Assuming styling consistency will not cause regressions.  
> - Risk of scope creep: integrating CI into testing may delay progress.  
> - Risk of over-focusing on “polish” (presentation readiness) before verifying functionality.

### 🧾 Results

#### 🧠 Discussion Notes
- Project remains aligned with the MVS goals — feasible plan evaluation and visual feedback loop are nearly functional.  
- Core table + contexts already match requirements from MVS (`R-6.10`–`R-6.12`).  
- Adding `EvaluationSection` will complete the first end-to-end user flow from data input → evaluation → summary feedback.

#### 🗝️ Key Decisions
- Allocate the 9-day window across all three backlog items with strict timeboxing to prevent scope creep.  
- Prioritize **Feedback System completion and regression testing** within the first 4 days to ensure a functional base.  
- Begin **End-to-End Testing** once feasibility logic and UI behavior are stable, reserving the last 2 days for **Presentation Readiness** and documentation polish.  
- Avoid adding new CI features or non-essential visual enhancements until all three items meet their Definition of Done.
- Refactor `End-to-End Testing` by removing CI related elements and moving into extra backlog item `CI Setup`

#### 📌 Action Items
- [ ] Backlog refactoring
  - [ ] Remove CI elements from `End-to-End Testing`
  - [ ] Move CI elements to `CI Setup`
- [ ] Finish EvaluationSection.jsx (week + daily accordions)  
- [ ] Add feasibility evaluation logic to handle daily aggregation  
- [ ] Implement consistent status shading logic  
- [ ] Run 5 regression tests and record results  
- [ ] Begin documentation updates (minimal draft only)
