### üìò Definition of Done
1. Create Improved Reward Plan/System Document for Sprint 4
- A written reward system document is created and stored in a central, accessible location (e.g., docs/ or Notion).
- The plan explicitly includes:
1. A daily 30-minute minimum code work requirement.
2. A minimum number of documented standup entries.
3. A dual-format standup system:
- High-level overview (PowerPoint or PDF)
- Technical log (Markdown or Notion page)
4. An updated timeline slide/image included in every standup.
5. ChatGPT is used for asynchronous standup feedback starting Friday, 6/13.
- Reward tiers (basic and enhanced) are tied directly to sprint goals and tracked accordingly.
2. All templates are written in Markdown and stored in a centralized templates/ folder (or .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ for GitHub integration)
3. Create and upload this new backlog item to GitHub
- Upload timeline and sprint planning document
- Complete all sections of the backlog template and convert to md file
