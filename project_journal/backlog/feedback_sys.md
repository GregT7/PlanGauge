# Feedback System

## üìù Task Overview
* Sprint: 9, 10
* Dates: September 17 - Month day (2025)
* Status: In Progress
* Story Points: #8
* Dependencies:
  * `Backend Setup`
  * `Intro to Flask`
  * `Subsystem Integration`
  * `Database Setup`
  * `UI UX Foundation`
  * `Intro to React`
  * `Data Entry Table`

* Task Description: Evaluate the feasibility of the overall plan by comparing the data entered in the task table with historical performance metrics. Include a summary of calculations done and visually update the system to reflect the current feasibility status.
* Expected Outcome: The system can evaluate the feasibility of the overall plan using the designed algorithms in real time as the user inputs data into the task table. The color scheme of subcomponents on the frontend will update to reflect the feasibility status. It will not be expected that the feasibility categorization algorithm will translate, with high accuracy, to the same status that a reasonable person may conclude without the use of the application. More research, fine tuning, data collection, and testing will probably be needed to settle on a robust algorithm that can, in practice, accurately evaluate feasibility.

  - [x] Default is used when data has been loaded but no task entries are in the table
  - [x] Unknown is used when any of the statuses are unknown

10) Testing
- [x] Unit: feasibility calculators (weekly, status-count, overall)
- [x] Unit: color mapping by feasibility
- [x] Integration (frontend): fetch success/error, loading, date-range update
- [x] Integration (backend): /api/stats happy path + validation error
- [x] E2E: user loads ‚Üí stats fetched ‚Üí feasibility computed ‚Üí outlines + button color update (informal)

### üìò Definition of Done

1) Backend Support (Flask/Supabase)
- [x] /api/db/stats returns all required statistical fields for both weekly and daily evaluations (avg, std, sums).
- [x] Date range query parameters (start, end) are validated; invalid input returns HTTP 400 with structured error JSON.
- [x] Standardized JSON envelope is used for every response with: { ok, service, now, response_time_ms, data{...}, error? }.
- Evidence
- [x] curl collection showing: valid request, invalid range, and malformed params.
- [x] Example JSON payloads saved under /project_management/api/flask_apis/xlsx.
- [x] Passing backend tests verifying structure and validation.

2) Data Fetch & State (Frontend)
- [x] React app calls GET /api/stats on mount and whenever date range changes.
- [x] Fetched data is stored in local state and parsed safely (guards against nulls, NaN, or missing keys).
- [x] Loading and error states render visible feedback (skeleton + retry or fallback message).
- [x] Swimlane diagram updated to include ‚Äústats fetch‚Äù step during startup flow.
- Evidence
- [x] Screenshot or GIF showing loading ‚Üí render ‚Üí error fallback sequence.
