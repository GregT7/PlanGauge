# Feedback System

## 📝 Task Overview
* Sprint: 9
* Dates: September 17 - Month day (2025)
* Status: In Progress
* Story Points: #
* Dependencies:
  * `Backend Setup`
  * `Intro to Flask`
  * `Subsystem Integration`
  * `Database Setup`
  * `UI UX Foundation`
  * `Intro to React`
  * `Data Entry Table`

* Task Description: Evaluate the feasibility of the overall plan by comparing the data entered in the task table with historical performance metrics. Include a summary of calculations done and visually update the system to reflect the current feasibility status.
* Expected Outcome: The system can evaluate the feasibility of the overall plan using the designed algorithms in real time as the user inputs data into the task table. The color scheme of subcomponents on the frontend will update to reflect the feasibility status. It will not be expected that the feasibility categorization algorithm will translate, with high accuracy, to the same status that a reasonable person may conclude without the use of the application. More research, fine tuning, data collection, and testing will probably be needed to settle on a robust algorithm that can, in practice, accurately evaluate feasibility.
