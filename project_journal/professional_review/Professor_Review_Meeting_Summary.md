# Professional Review of Project & Career

## Action Plan
- finish the sprint retrospective for sprint 2
- update the timeline
- add content to GitHub (presentation + notion documentation)
- update mvs

## Date
@May 28, 2025

## Issue Identified
- ml based estimation of task-time-duration is complicated and will require significantly more development time with a steeper learning curve
- standups and sprint endings are inconsistent
- vibe coding reliance prioritizes production speed over code quality and understanding
- docker implementation requires the completion of a basic working model for the project and is not helpful for my frontend architecture

## Proposed Solutions
- simplify ml estimation approach
--- use averages and standard deviations for feasibility estimation for day and overall week
--- use keyword search/association for rough estimates of individual task durations
- don't worry too much about having some off days in the week as long as there aren't too many days of inactivity
- limit weekly planning while drinking coffee/caffeine so I don't overestimate my capabilities and overbook a week of tasks I likely won't complete

## Root Cause
- lack of understanding and knowledge of technology/machine learning
- impulsive use of technology demotivates and distracts me
- not going to bed at a consistent time period
- managing other life issues at same time

## Sprint Dashboard
Sprint 2 - Basic Frontend
,
Sprint 1 - Project Foundation & Setup

## What Didn’t Go Well
ML implementation seems complicated especially given my lack of knowledge/experience in the domain, the tool itself doesn't seem too helpful -- can plan things quickly without needing this project

## What Went Well
Solo-scrum is a good idea, shows self-motivation/discipline and familiarity/willingness to learn agile. Project is good for gaining experience and knowledge of the SWE process. Tech stack architecture is feasible. Responsible use of ChatGPT is great — helps speed up learning and development.

## Notes
- use docker at end once something basic is up and working, think about pairing it with some cloud service (AWS, Azure)
- remove docker container for the front end, just do it for the backend
- expect the tech stack to grow/change as time goes on
- think about putting off scikit-learn/ml aspect of project and implement something more basic -- just use the average and standard deviations of data as a rough estimator of feasibility (also consider using keyword associations)
- the most difficult part of this project is the machine learning part -- might want to reconsider until I have an improved skillset and understanding of things
- if you go down the ml route for the project; think about taking additional courses on ml, look into
- think about adding additional feature where you can load in plans from the past: see what the stat card evaluations were, the set of planned tasks, the feasibility ranges
- Although Solo-scum lacks the core team element of the agile methodology, this projects approach shows a detailed understanding of the methodology and would look good on a resume
- using generative AI is ok for speeding up the coding process as long as you understand the code its spitting out, its also a great tool for learning the content. Treat ChatGPT like its a professor, try to create and take quizzes that it generates to engage you in an active learning style.
- also for a resume, showing that you can use ChatGPT efficiently and responsibly is a big plus -- prompt engineering
- for the ml prediction model (if I consider it), there is no guarantee for how accurate the model will be in making predictions. Accuracy metrics are dependent on the dataset and its quality.
- to evaluate the accuracy of the model -- train the model on a percentage of teh data, saving some of teh data for testing. For a really good understanding of its performance accuracy, repeat this for all combinations of data (training(set of imgs, num images), testing(set of imgs, num images)
- for the ml modelconsider looking into random forest modelgradient booster regressor is goodif variability in the data is large and the accuracy is poor, this indicates that more data will be needed to improve accuracy
- consider looking into random forest model
- gradient booster regressor is good
- if variability in the data is large and the accuracy is poor, this indicates that more data will be needed to improve accuracy
- for improving solo-scrum, just stick too it and update content to GitHub
- the overall tool might not be that helpful in making plans but its still a good project to get more experience
- framing this project for hiring managers: frame it the same way I did here-- completed this project for three reasons 1. To get more experienced with the agile methodology, 2. Build a tool that will assist me with planning for the week, 3. Assist in developing my application
- Career path: SWE vs AI/ML/Data analyst --- go for SWE, AI/ML stuff requires more knowledge and experience, is more complicated, take some courses to see if you like it first
- Don't count this project towards "2 years professional experience" --- this is reserved for internships and full time positions working in the software development field
- PhD vs masters --- don't think about getting a PhD before getting a masters; see if you really like learning about a specific topic and wouldn't mind digging into it even deeper to become an expert in the topic. Also, some companies will offer free tuition assistance for getting their masters degree. A masters degree is also very different from undergrad because you only take courses on one specific topic and nothing else so you have to really like the subject-content to pursue this degree.
