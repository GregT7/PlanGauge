## 🧭 Action Plan

- Put all items/goals I need to accomplish for the week inside a word document then print it  
- Establish a baseline goal and offer a reward for reaching it  
  - Don’t drink Baja Blast Freeze + true crime podcast for next week  
  - **Reward:** listening to true crime + podcast + driving through scenic area

## ⚠️ Root Cause

- Watching too much YouTube  
- Going to bed too late and inconsistently
