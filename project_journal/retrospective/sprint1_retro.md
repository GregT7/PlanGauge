## 🛠️ Solutions

**Proposed Solutions**
1. Organize a consistent meeting time in the morning for the daily standups
2. Fill out the standup agenda prior
3. For meetings, create flexible presentation where visuals are included, share this using the tv
4. Put specific actions and the day under the sprint file in Notion (Sprint dashboard)
- pool from backlog, daily standup, and retrospective
5. Email Dr. Raymer and try to schedule a meeting discussing the first sprint and progress so far

**Action Plan**
1. Coordinate with parents to find a good meet time (try not to choose a time too early or too late)
2. Put standup prep in weekly plan
3. Put HDMI chord next to tv for easy presentation setup
4. Create template standup presenation slides and save in easily rememberable location
5. Prior to standup, put todo items for the day inside the current sprint's respective page, detailing the date
6. Email Dr. Raymer to schedule meeting if possible
