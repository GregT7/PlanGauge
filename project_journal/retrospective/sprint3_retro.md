# üåÄ Retrospective #3 ‚Äì Finally Started Writing My Own Code

## üìã Summary
**Date:** Wednesday, June 11, 2025

**What Went Well**
- Completed the React course and adapted well despite initial confusion with the technology.
- Implemented the data entry table with minimal ChatGPT assistance.
- Followed through with next steps from standups:
- Implemented Context API as discussed.
- Repackaged larger goals into new backlog items for better tracking.
- Acted on past retrospective suggestions, such as starting to incrementally test code.
- Applied recent advice to avoid premature focus on the ML model; used rough estimators instead to get a working prototype up and running.
- Created and followed an entertainment management plan that helped structure my time; qualified for both basic and extended rewards.

**What Didn't Go Well**
- Inconsistent standup schedule (only completed 2 out of 10 possible days).
- Did not work on the project every day; progress was slower than anticipated.
- Found it difficult to implement ideas quickly due to limited coding experience.
- As the project became more technical, the feedback I received was less relevant and actionable.
- Entertainment management plan lost effectiveness by Day 7 and was gamified (e.g., waiting until midnight to binge).
- Focus shifted away from this project due to other commitments and distractions.

## üß© Problems

**Issues Identified**
- Project manager (Dad) lacks technical expertise, limiting the depth of feedback on implementation issues.
- My updates do not align with my audience's perspective; Dad understands planning, not the codebase.
- Time and energy were diverted by planning for my Japan trip and other external stressors.
- Reward systems were not project-specific, making progress feel less tied to incentives.
- Standups were harder to coordinate while Dad was traveling.
- Lack of prior experience in coding led to underestimating the time required to implement features.

**Root Cause**
The core issues this sprint stemmed from a combination of structural gaps, limited technical confidence, and inconsistent accountability systems. Standups were infrequent due to both logistical challenges (e.g., Dad‚Äôs availability while traveling) and a lack of personal urgency stemming from insufficient reinforcement. Technical progress slowed as the project shifted from planning‚Äîwhere feedback was clearer and more actionable‚Äîinto areas requiring hands-on coding, where I lacked confidence and independent problem-solving experience. My productivity also suffered from a diluted focus: although I followed a general entertainment management plan, it wasn‚Äôt tied directly to this project, so the effort didn‚Äôt translate into meaningful momentum. Compounding this, external life obligations (like preparing for my Japan trip) made it difficult to sustain consistent attention and energy. Overall, these factors created a feedback loop: reduced feedback quality, increased implementation friction, and a weakening discipline system led to slow execution and declining motivation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Solutions

**Proposed Solutions**
- Consider using ChatGPT for asynchronous standup feedback when unavailable.
- Explore restructuring the entertainment management plan to better support project-specific progress.
- Evaluate creating new backlog groupings based on retrospective themes (e.g., technical growth, testing, planning).

**Action Plan**
- Rebuild the entertainment management plan with required standups and 30+ min daily coding tied to project rewards.
- Prepare high-level and technical standup versions; shift to async format when Dad is unavailable.
- Create GitHub templates for PRs, standups, retrospectives, and sprint dashboards.
- Generate new themed backlog item for retrospective 3 for easier implementation of action plan
