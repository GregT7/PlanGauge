# üåÄ Retrospective #3 ‚Äì Finally Started Writing My Own Code

## üìã Summary
**Date:** Wednesday, June 11, 2025

**What Went Well**
- Completed the React course and adapted well despite initial confusion with the technology.
- Implemented the data entry table with minimal ChatGPT assistance.
- Followed through with next steps from standups:
    - Implemented Context API as discussed.
    - Repackaged larger goals into new backlog items for better tracking and project management.
    - Acted on past retrospective suggestions, such as starting to incrementally test code.
    - Updated plans and documentation to avoid premature focus on the ML model; plan to use rough estimators instead to get a working prototype up and running.
    - Created and followed an entertainment management plan that helped structure my time.

**What Didn't Go Well**
- Inconsistent standup schedule (only completed 2 out of 10 possible days).
- Did not work on the project every day; progress was slower than anticipated.
- Found it difficult to implement ideas quickly due to limited coding experience.
- As the project became more technical, the feedback I received was less relevant and actionable.
- Entertainment management plan lost effectiveness by Day 7 and was gamified (e.g., waiting until midnight to binge).
- Focus shifted away from this project due to other commitments and distractions.

## üß© Problems

**Issues Identified**
- The project manager lacks technical expertise, which limits the depth and specificity of feedback on implementation-related challenges.
- Project updates have not been sufficiently aligned with the project manager‚Äôs perspective; while they are familiar with planning processes they lack context regarding the technical details of the codebase.
- Time and energy were diverted due to preparations for an upcoming trip to Japan and other external stressors, impacting focus and consistency.
- The reward system lacked direct relevance to project milestones, reducing its effectiveness in reinforcing task completion.
- Standup coordination was inconsistent due to the project manager's travel schedule, affecting communication flow and accountability.
- Inexperience with certain technical tasks led to underestimating the time and complexity involved in feature implementation.

**Root Cause**
- Structural gaps in the project workflow and accountability systems contributed to inconsistent execution.
- Technical confidence was limited, particularly as the project transitioned from planning (where feedback was clearer) to hands-on implementation.
- Standups were infrequent due to logistical challenges, including the project manager‚Äôs travel schedule.
- Productivity declined as progress moved into areas requiring independent coding and problem-solving, where I lacked prior experience.
- External obligations (e.g., preparing for an extended trip to Japan) further diluted attention and energy across the sprint.
- These factors compounded to reduce feedback quality and increase implementation friction, ultimately slowing overall execution.

## üõ†Ô∏è Solutions

**Proposed Solutions**
- Consider using ChatGPT for asynchronous standup feedback when project manager unavailable.
- Explore restructuring the entertainment management plan to better support project-specific progress.
- Evaluate creating new backlog groupings based on retrospective themes (e.g., technical growth, testing, planning).

**Action Plan**
- Rebuild the entertainment management plan with required standups and 30+ min daily coding tied to project rewards.
- Prepare high-level and technical standup versions; shift to async format when Dad is unavailable.
- Create GitHub templates for PRs, standups, retrospectives, and sprint dashboards.
- Generate new themed backlog item for retrospective 3 for easier implementation of action plan
