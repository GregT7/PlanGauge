# üåÄ Retrospective #5 ‚Äì Planning & Documentation Lag

## üìã Summary
**Date:** Tuesday, June 24, 2025
**What Went Well**
1. Finished all planned work
    - Completed all 3 assigned backlog items
    - Merged 2 pull requests with feature-ready code

2. Improved consistency and discipline
    - Hosted standup meetings 6 out of 7 days ‚Äî a major improvement over past sprints
    - Followed the personal improvement plan exactly as intended

3. Strong execution on feedback and planning
    - Implemented many ideas discussed during standups
    - Created new backlog items thoughtfully (e.g., CI/CD for resume enhancement, testing prep for expected workload)

4. High attention to quality
    - Thoroughly tested frontend components and added prop-level error handling
    - Acted quickly to fix code that caused tests to fail
    - Added GIFs to PRs to showcase features for clearer visibility

5. Effective use of support tools
    - Created ChatGPT-guided quizzes to fill in knowledge gaps from incomplete content

**What Didn't Go Well**
1. Retrospective was not completed during the sprint
    - The Sprint 5 retrospective carried over into Sprint 6, delaying the feedback loop.
    - This made it harder to immediately reflect on what worked and what could be improved.

2. Sprint ended without a formal transition plan
    - Although it was a deliberate choice to wait on backend planning, this left Sprint 5 without a clear documented handoff.
    - As a result, Sprint 6 started with some ambiguity and required time to clarify the next steps.

3. Sprint scope pushed energy limits by the end
    - Completing the stat card system was a solid technical milestone, but it consumed most available bandwidth.
    - This left little time or energy to close out the sprint process, suggesting the scope may have been slightly too ambitious.

## üß© Problems

**Issues Identified**
1. Retrospective Slippage
    - The Sprint 5 retrospective was not completed on time, delaying reflection and causing some context loss heading into Sprint 6.

2. Unclear Transition Planning
    - The sprint wrapped up without a defined path into backend or database work. This caused some friction at the start of Sprint 6 as direction had to be clarified reactively.

3. No Architectural Diagrams Available
    - While not a blocker during Sprint 5, the lack of visuals (e.g. swim lane or data flow diagrams) became a bottleneck when planning Sprint 6 backend tasks.

4. Slight Overextension Toward Sprint End
    - High output (e.g., two PRs, full backlog completion) led to energy depletion, which may have contributed to process tasks like retrospectives being skipped.

5. Testing Not Yet Linked to Backend Data Flow
    - While frontend testing was thorough, no integration or mock data tests were written yet ‚Äî leaving a future gap that must be addressed in upcoming sprints.


**Root Cause**
1. Process closure was deprioritized due to fatigue
    - Focus and energy were concentrated on completing core technical tasks (e.g. stat card system), leaving limited bandwidth for reflective tasks like the retrospective.

2. Intentional deferral of planning tasks
    - Transition planning and visual diagrams were consciously delayed to avoid premature design. While a valid strategy, it led to ambiguity when the next sprint began.

3. Backend planning lacked upstream alignment
    - The backend setup was initially scoped without fully recognizing its dependency on a defined database schema. This created uncertainty when implementation began.

4. Planning buffer was not built into sprint schedule
    - All available time was allocated to feature work, leaving little slack for cleanup, planning, or architectural prep work near the sprint‚Äôs end.

5. Testing priorities focused on UI functionality
    - Since backend work hadn‚Äôt started, integration testing wasn‚Äôt a priority ‚Äî but the sprint didn‚Äôt include a placeholder or mock test plan, creating a gap.

## üõ†Ô∏è Solutions

**Proposed Solutions**
1. Schedule and timebox retrospectives before sprint ends
    - Block out time on the final sprint day to complete the retrospective and next sprint planning. Treat it as non-negotiable to protect reflection and momentum.

2. Create early-stage planning diagrams before development begins
    - Roughly sketch key workflows (e.g., data flow or swim lanes) before implementing features. These don‚Äôt need to be polished ‚Äî they‚Äôre meant to support thinking, not presentation.

3. Add 10‚Äì15% buffer in sprint scope for planning & process
    - Cap technical task load slightly below 100% capacity to preserve energy for retrospectives, diagrams, documentation, and architectural thinking.


**Action Plan**
1. Timebox sprint retrospective and planning
    - Reserve 2 hours at the end of each sprint to complete the retrospective and plan the next sprint. Make it a recurring task in your system.

2. Start visual planning earlier in each sprint
    - Begin rough diagrams (e.g., schema, dataflow, swim lanes) as soon as related backlog items are selected ‚Äî not during implementation.

3. Include a 10‚Äì15% buffer for planning and process work
    - Intentionally under-allocate technical tasks to preserve time for retrospectives, documentation, and architectural tasks.
    - Reassign backend integration backlog item to next sprint, dedicate this sprint to just setting up the database. If this item is finished early, then add backend task to this sprint.

4. Maintain consistency with daily standups
    - Continue the strong habit of holding standups on 6 out of 7 days. Use them to self-correct drift and surface blockers early.
