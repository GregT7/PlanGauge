# 🌀 Retrospective #4 – Overestimating Capabilities

## 📋 Summary
**Date:** Tuesday, June 17, 2025

**What Went Well**
- was adaptive:
  - put new tasks into backlog items for improved organization
  - started using chatGPT for hosting standups
  - started automating documentation of standups using chatGPT
  - leveraged feedback from ChatGPT to improve ChatGPT based standups
  - created quizzes for learning how to use react testing-library + vitest
- completed the documentation backlog item
- started implementing updated motivation/reward plan with success so far
- was thorough with unit testing of 2 components

**What Didn't Go Well**
- Overestimated capabilities: tasks took a lot longer than expected
- assigned too many backlog items
- Felt like not a lot of progress was made
- Documentation takes a long time to complete
- Took me two days to complete two test files for unit testing

---

## 🧩 Problems

**Issues Identified**
- spent a lot of time writing up documentation
- didn't get close to finishing all backlog items assigned

**Root Cause**
- chose too many backlog items for the sprint
- wrote up standups using two different formats for each standup with a lot of overlap in content sections

---

## 🛠️ Solutions

**Proposed Solutions**
- use ChatGPT to automate .md formatting, combine the two different formats into a singular format, update the standup template
- add a max of 2 backlog items for each sprint, then append new items if all other items get finished --> sprint 5 (1. Intro to code reviews & testing + 2. Retro3: Reward Plan 2.0

**Action Plan**
- create a file describing the new standup process and store in the template directory (include list of ChatGPT questions to ask)
- create new standup and assign the previously mentioned backlog items
