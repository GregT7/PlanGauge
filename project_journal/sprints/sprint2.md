## üîç Review
* Major Feedback: Need to complete a timeline that shows the overall progress and state of the project for a high level overview. When giving standups, it‚Äôs not clear what is accomplished or where I am at.
* Retrospective Notes: During Sprint 2 (Basic Frontend), I struggled with consistency, missed daily standups, didn‚Äôt finish key tasks like the UI/UX quizzes and a 13-hour course, and often wasted time due to excessive YouTube and podcasts, poor sleep, and low motivation. To address this, I created an action plan: listing weekly goals in a printed document, setting a baseline goal tied to a reward (avoiding entertainment for a week in exchange for a scenic drive with podcasts), and limiting entertainment to 4 hours per day using a stopwatch. Despite setbacks, I recognized my lack of React understanding, added a new backlog item, made strong progress in a React course, and received valuable feedback from Dr. Raymer.
