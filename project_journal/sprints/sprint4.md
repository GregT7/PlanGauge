* Goal: Catch up on key documentation, gain hands-on experience with testing React applications, and complete a simulated code review to reinforce professional development skills.
* Objective: The objective is to finalize or update all relevant documentation for the MVS, sprint progress, backlog items, retrospectives, and standups; apply unit and integration testing across all components using React Testing Library with Vitest; and simulate a complete code review process through pull requests that include thorough documentation of recommendations, rationale, and implemented changes.
* Milestones:
    1. Documentation
        1. Sprint 1-4 backlog items are all defined and added to GitHub
        2. Sprint 3 standup documentation is completed
        3. MVS has specific requirements appended to document for all components that clearly establish the definition of done

        6. Overall and immediate timelines (sprint 4) are updated
    2. Testing
        1. Write unit tests for all components
        2. Write at least 3 integration tests that involve at least 2 components in each test
        3. Debug all failed test cases until they pass
    3. Code Review
        1. PR is well defined/documented
        2. Suggested revisions and analysis is saved to a document
