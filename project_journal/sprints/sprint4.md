# Sprint 4

## 📝 Overview
* Dates: June 9 - June 16 (2025)
* Status: In Progress
* Backlog Progress: 0 item / 4 items (0%)
* Backlogs Assigned:
    * Intro to Code Reviews & Testing
    * Documentation Catchup
    * Stat Card System
    * Retro3: Reward System 2.0
* Goal: Catch up on key documentation, gain hands-on experience with testing React applications, and complete a simulated code review to reinforce professional development skills.
* Objective: The objective is to finalize or update all relevant documentation for the MVS, sprint progress, backlog items, retrospectives, and standups; apply unit and integration testing across all components using React Testing Library with Vitest; and simulate a complete code review process through pull requests that include thorough documentation of recommendations, rationale, and implemented changes.
* Milestones:
    1. Documentation
        1. Sprint 1-4 backlog items are all defined and added to GitHub
        2. Sprint 3 standup documentation is completed
        3. MVS has specific requirements appended to document for all components that clearly establish the definition of done
        4. The following are reformatted/updated: sprint dashboard items (1), standup items (1,2,3), retrospectives (1,2), folder structure for "sprints" directory (separate assets into distinct folder)
        5. Sprint dashboard items (2,3) and drafts (4) are completed
        6. Overall and immediate timelines (sprint 4) are updated
    2. Testing
        1. Write unit tests for all components
        2. Write at least 3 integration tests that involve at least 2 components in each test
        3. Debug all failed test cases until they pass
    3. Code Review
        1. PR is well defined/documented
        2. Suggested revisions and analysis is saved to a document
        3. Fixes and refactoring is successfully performed
	    4. The pull request is reviewed and merged

## 🔍 Review
* Major Feedback:
    * This sprint highlighted a recurring issue of overestimating personal capacity, leading to frustration when only a portion of the planned backlog items were completed. While strong improvements were made in automating documentation and integrating ChatGPT for standups and quizzes, the time costs of thorough documentation and testing were greater than anticipated. Writing in dual standup formats proved inefficient, and unit testing took longer due to a high standard of completeness or unfamiliarity with tools. Despite these challenges, the sprint demonstrated adaptability through structural changes, increased clarity in planning, and a proactive approach to feedback and iteration.
* Retrospective Notes:
    * Sprint 4 focused on refining workflows and expanding testing efforts but was ultimately slowed by overly ambitious planning and high documentation demands. Key progress included successful integration of ChatGPT into daily processes, development of unit tests for two components, and implementation of a motivational reward system. However, the volume of assigned tasks outpaced available time, and the use of two separate standup formats added unnecessary work. In response, the plan moving forward is to simplify the standup process, limit each sprint to two backlog items, and continue refining workflows to align capacity with expectations.
