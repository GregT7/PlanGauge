## üîç Review
* Major Feedback:
    - Successfully completed all assigned backlog items and merged two clean, well-documented pull requests.
    - Demonstrated noticeable growth in planning consistency through daily standups and improved task tracking.
    - Frontend development is in a strong place ‚Äî system is modular, tested, and visually functional.
    - Project timeline may be at risk if backend and database phases don‚Äôt begin with stronger structure and planning discipline.
    - Planning gaps from this sprint revealed the need for enforcing backlog dependencies more strictly and reserving space for process work.
* Retrospective Notes: insert text here...
    - Maintained high momentum with 6/7 days of standups and full backlog completion.
    - Deferred retrospectives and backend planning created friction moving into Sprint 6.
    - Felt slightly overextended near the end of the sprint, causing skipped reflection tasks.
    - Chose to delay diagrams and integration planning to avoid burnout ‚Äî a tradeoff that was intentional but had consequences.
    - Learned the importance of respecting existing backlog dependencies and enforcing transition space.
