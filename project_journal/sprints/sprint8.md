# Sprint 8 - Glue Everything Together

## üìù Overview
* Dates: September 1 - September 16 (2025)
* Status: In Progress
* Backlog Progress: 0 backlogs completed / 3 backlogs assigned ( 0% )
* Tasks Assigned:
    * Intro to Flask
    * Backend Setup
    * Subsystem Integration
* Goal: Establish basic connection between all subsystems of application: frontend, backend, database, Notion API
* Objective: First complete learning about flask, then finish the backend setup. Afterwards, connect basic setups of subsystems to lay the groundwork for features like post submission and application startup
* Milestones:
    1. Writing Flask quiz is completed
    2. Pass Flask quiz with a score of 70% or greater
    3. Flask endpoint /api/stats is completed and accessible
    4. Health API endpoints for Flask are written: 1. Supabase (database), 2. Notion External API
    5. Living document for Flask API endpoints is created and updated
    6. Connectivity for the following is established AND documented
    ------ React ‚Üî Flask
    ------ Flask ‚Üî Database
    ------ Flask ‚Üî Notion

## üîç Review
* Major Feedback: Extending this sprint to two weeks worked out really well. I had enough time to finish all of the original backlog items, add Plan Submission, and still leave room at the end for documentation and planning. My standup participation was higher than usual, and I followed through on most key decisions. I also did a good job documenting my pull requests with GIFs and diagrams, which made them cleaner. On the downside, I let scope creep slip in again ‚Äî I added an extra quiz, some styling changes, alert systems, and diagrams that weren‚Äôt in the DoD. Progress felt slower than I‚Äôd like since I only worked about 3‚Äì4 hours a day, and I‚Äôm still questioning how useful the application will actually be since the MVS isn‚Äôt being followed very closely. Toward the end I also leaned on ChatGPT to generate some unit tests, which made me feel like I wasn‚Äôt getting as much hands-on learning out of it.
* Retrospective Notes: Making this sprint two weeks long gave me the breathing room I needed to make steady progress, and leaving the last couple of days for documentation and planning is something I definitely want to keep doing. At the same time, scope creep is still a problem ‚Äî I get excited when defining backlog items and end up adding too much, especially when I‚Äôm hyped up on caffeine. That‚Äôs been slowing things down and making it harder to stick to what‚Äôs essential. My daily working hours are still low, since once I leave Starbucks I end up defaulting to TV or YouTube instead of doing more project work at home. I also feel unsure about the project‚Äôs overall usefulness, which has been affecting my motivation. Going forward, I need to stick closer to the MVS, treat Extras as truly optional, and try adjusting my work routine so I can get more hours in. Getting outside feedback earlier will also help me figure out if the app is on the right track and worth continuing to invest in.
