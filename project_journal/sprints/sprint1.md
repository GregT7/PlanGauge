## 🔍 Review
* Major Feedback: The goal and all milestones were not achieved. Not all of the “Intro to Solo-scrum” and “UI/UX Foundation” backlog item subtasks were completed, albeit a small number of tasks remain. These backlog items were rolled over into the next sprint. This causes a problem where sprint 2 now carries an unfeasible work load so an additional sprint has been added and the remaining backlog items have been redistributed. While only one out of three backlog items were completed this sprint, the progress made was still sufficient. Overall, this sprint’s progress and execution was good.
* Retrospective Notes: Adapting to the agile process has been overwhelming and difficult to manage. Meetings often took place at inconsistent times, usually later in the day after work, and lacked proper preparation. Without structure or clear visuals, these meetings were confusing, making it hard for team members to understand the project’s progress. To address these issues in the next sprint, the plan is to create a visual timeline to guide the project, use a consistent presentation format for standups, centralize all tasks on the sprint page to stay organized, and schedule standups earlier in the day with materials prepared ahead of time.
