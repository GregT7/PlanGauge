# Sprint 10 - Finishing Up

## üìù Overview
* Dates: October 2nd (2025) - October 13th (2025)
* Status: In Progress
* Backlog Progress: # backlogs completed / # backlogs assigned ( X% )
* Tasks Assigned:
    * `Feedback System`
    * `End-to-End Testing`
    * `Presentation Readiness`
* Goal: Wrap up project development and testing while making sure the github page and surrounding documentation is presentable to employers.
* Objective: Complete the final feature of the project Feedback System with thorough unit and integration testing. Next, learn how to write and execute end-to-end tests with some tool to ensure everything works as intended. Finally, update documentation (mvs, design specifications, etc), comment code, and create a presentable readme that employers can easily understand.
* Milestones:
    1. Feedback System  
        - Completed EvaluationSection  
        - Styling applied from feasibility evaluation  
        - Regression + new component/utility tests passing  
    2. End-to-End Testing  
        - Decide on testing framework  
        - Implementation TBD  
    3. Presentation Readiness  
        - Final drafts complete (mvs.md, design.md, reqs.md, sdp.md, user-stories.md, readme.md)  
        - Improve tone/content (remove blog-like notes, non-code backlog items, ensure no PPI)  
        - Update Resume/CV (draft bullet points, add strongest ones)  
        - Usability/Demo (readme instructions, GitHub download/setup verified)  
        - External Review (Uncle Steve, possibly WSU-CS professor, parents presentation)
