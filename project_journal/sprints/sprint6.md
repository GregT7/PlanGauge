# Sprint 6 - Intro to Backend

## üìù Overview
* Dates: June 24 - June 29 (2025)
* Status: In Progress
* Backlog Progress: 0 items completed / 1 item assigned ( 0% )
* Tasks Assigned:
    * Database Setup & Integration
* Goal: Establish a clean, structured, and accessible MongoDB database to support backend development and basic prediction algorithm. This includes auditing and preprocessing raw productivity data, defining a privacy-conscious schema, ensuring secure Atlas cluster access, inserting test-ready records, and documenting connection procedures for seamless backend use.
* Objective: insert text here...
* Milestones:
    1. Clean and filter MongoDB data
    2. Finish visual diagram for schema design
    3. Upload cleaned data to MongoDB cluster
    4. Write common queries and create indexes for each
    5. Setup access rules and successfully connect to DB
    6. Pass all mock backend integration tests
    7. Finish & upload instruction documentation

## üîç Review
* Major Feedback: Sprint 6 exposed critical planning issues, including overly broad backlog items, unclear dependencies, and unrealistic scope given time constraints. Despite low completion, it was a pivotal sprint marked by a smart architectural pivot from MongoDB to Supabase and deeper understanding of Flask integration needs. Some self-awareness was demonstrated through identifying fatigue and proposing a sustainable work schedule and clearer sprint structure. Moving forward, improving documentation during pivots, refining backlog decomposition, and enforcing a consistent workflow will support better execution.
* Retrospective Notes: The retrospective notes highlighted poor backlog planning, with items being too broad, lacking clear subtasks, and containing confusing dependencies. A key architectural shift from MongoDB to Supabase was made after reassessing project needs. The sprint suffered from reduced available work time, burnout, and a lack of documentation updates. Proposed solutions included implementing a consistent work schedule, reserving the last day of each sprint for retrospectives and planning, assigning fewer backlog items, and better defining immediate future tasks.
