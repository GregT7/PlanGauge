# Sprint 11 - Project Polishing

## 📝 Overview
* Dates: October 17th - October 31st (2025)
* Status: In Progress
* Backlog Progress: 2 backlogs completed / 2 backlogs assigned ( 100% )
* Tasks Assigned:
    * `Presentation Readiness`
    * `End-to-End Testing`
* Goal: Finalize the project for presentation to employers by ensuring it is clear, accessible, and professionally documented. The project should effectively communicate its purpose, functionality, and installation process while demonstrating technical competence and completeness. Conduct final testing to confirm that all major systems function as intended.
* Objective: Polish all remaining documentation and presentation materials, including the README, diagrams, and tutorial content. Simplify and validate end-to-end testing to verify key user workflows, then finalize the project’s deliverables—ensuring that everything is well-organized, easy to follow, and ready for public review.
* Milestones: 
    1. `Presentation Readiness`
        - Readme
            - demo recording
            - overview
            - how to install tutorial
            - how to run tutorial
        - launch script (activates venv + launches both servers)
        - implement loose testing mode
        - Final reviews
            - Uncle Steve
            - Dr. Raymer (?)
            - Parents
        - Resume + cv updated
    2. `End-to-End Testing`
        - Playwright successfully installed with a dummy test passing
        - testing launch script works
        - 3 major tests written & pass
        - documentation updated

## 🔍 Review
* Major Feedback: Sprint 11 demonstrated strong progress despite reduced time availability. You successfully re-scoped the backlog to focus on documentation, testing, and presentation readiness while maintaining consistency in daily reflections. The most recurring feedback centers on idea overload and unclear prioritization. Establishing a lightweight, repeatable prioritization system will help convert creativity into focused execution. Maintaining a smaller, well-defined sprint goal was effective and should continue.

* Retrospective Notes: This sprint marked a turning point from feature building to process refinement. You managed competing priorities between job applications and project closure without sacrificing output quality. However, scope creep and accumulating ideas created friction in decision-making. The new minimal Impact–Effort prioritization framework directly addresses this by giving a clear, low-effort structure for deciding what matters each sprint. Overall, Sprint 11 showed maturity in balancing reflection, discipline, and adaptability.
