## üßæ Overview  
Designed and implemented the **Stat Card System**, a key UI feature for visualizing the feasibility of each day's task load based on predicted time durations. Each card displays the total planned time for a specific day and uses intuitive color indicators‚Äî**green** (within range), **yellow** (slightly overambitious), or **red** (unrealistic; plan likely needs revision)‚Äîto communicate how realistic the plan is. Feasibility is determined using simple `Z-score` thresholds based on historical task duration patterns.

## üõ†Ô∏è Changes

### ‚úÖ Created New Test Files
- `CountElement.jsx` + test ‚Äî Colored circle representing a status count; used by `StatusCounter`
- `StatCard.jsx` + test ‚Äî Displays individual stat card with total time, date, and `Z-score`-based status coloring
- `StatCardSystem.jsx` + test ‚Äî Renders seven `StatCard` components (one per day) and includes a status summary
- `StatusCounter.jsx` + test ‚Äî Tallies and displays counts of `"good"`, `"moderate"`, and `"poor"` statuses
- `TaskTable_StatCardSystem.test.jsx` ‚Äî Integration tests between `TaskTable` and `StatCardSystem`
- `toLocaleMidnight.js` ‚Äî Utility for normalizing date comparisons
- `start_tasks.json` ‚Äî Sample task data for testing
- `cardData.json` ‚Äî Day-specific time threshold metadata
- `EvaluationContext.jsx` ‚Äî Created as a placeholder context file for sharing plan feasibility across components (currently blank for future use)

### üîß Modified Existing Files
- `TaskContext.jsx`:  
  - Added prop validation and error handling  
  - Moved `timeSum` logic (via `useMemo`) into context  
- `App.jsx`: Added `StatCardSystem` to the layout  
- `/utils/`: New directory for utility scripts and mock data  
- TaskTable.jsx: Updated styling -- Wrapped component in a dashed-border container to align more closely with the original UI mockup

## üìÇ Branch Info  
- **Base**: `main`  
- **Feature**: `stat_card_system`  

> This PR merges stat card components and integration logic that evaluate plan feasibility and share task data between core components.

## üß† ChatGPT Review ‚Äì PR #2: Stat Card System Integration

### ‚è±Ô∏è Timeliness
The Stat Card System feature appears to have been designed and implemented efficiently. Based on the scope of the changes and the clarity of the output, it's clear that thoughtful planning was involved. The use of modular components and consistent styling suggests steady progress aligned with the overall project design.

**Verdict:** ‚úÖ Timely and well-scoped implementation.

---

### üß† Code Quality
The code additions and changes are logically separated and clearly documented. Specific strengths include:

- Clean component breakdown (`StatCard`, `StatusCounter`, `CountElement`, etc.)
- Use of `useMemo`, context patterns (`TaskContext`, `EvaluationContext`), and test files show awareness of scalability and state management.
- Thoughtful integration testing (`TaskTable_StatCardSystem.test.jsx`) validates core system interactions.

Minor areas to improve:
- The placeholder `EvaluationContext.jsx` could use a comment or TODO to explain its future role.
- Slight wording tweaks in changelogs (already discussed) would enhance clarity, but these are non-blocking.

**Verdict:** ‚úÖ High-quality, maintainable code with minor polish needed.

---

### üìä Overall Score  
**Score:** 9.5 / 10

**Reasoning:**  
This is an excellent, comprehensive feature PR with thoughtful design, well-tested logic, and clean visuals. The only minor deductions are for some unpolished phrasing and the blank context file. Otherwise, it's a model example of how to deliver a cross-component feature with integrated state sharing and clear UX value.

Great work ‚Äî looking forward to seeing this merged!
