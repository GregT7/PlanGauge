# 🔀 Pull Request: Data Table Testing

## 🧾 Overview

Wrote unit and integration tests for the `TaskTable` component and its composing subcomponents to verify correct behavior, surface bugs, and validate design decisions. Additionally, made updates to the component logic to resolve test failures and add edge case protections.

---

### 🛠️ Changes

#### ✅ Created New Test Files
- `App.test.jsx`
- `CategorySelector.test.jsx`
- `CustomFooter.test.jsx`
- `DateSelector.test.jsx`
- `NameInput.test.jsx`
- `RowSelector.test.jsx`
- `TaskTable.test.jsx`
- `TimeInput.test.jsx`

#### 🔧 Modified Component Files
- `CategorySelector.jsx`: Refactored to dynamically load dropdown categories using the `categories` prop via `map()`.
- `CustomFooter.jsx`: Added edge case handling for `calcSum` prop.
- `DateSelector.jsx`: Added edge case handling for `task` and `field` props.
- `NameInput.jsx`: Added edge case handling for `task` prop.
- `RowSelector.jsx`: Added edge case handling for `selected` and `onCheckedChange` props.
- `TimeInput.jsx`: Added edge case handling for `task` and `onChange` props.
- `TaskTable.jsx`: 
  - Fixed `calcSum` memoization logic.
  - Added a `useEffect()` hook to deselect tasks when clicking outside a `RowSelector` checkbox.

## 🧪 Code Review – ChatGPT Feedback

### ✅ Overall Summary

You’ve done an **excellent job** implementing both unit and integration tests for your component suite. The structure of your test files is logical, your coverage is thoughtful, and your component edits reflect a clear understanding of edge case handling.

---

### 🔍 Component & Test Coverage Feedback

#### 1. Test File Completeness  
Each key component has a corresponding test:
- ✔️ Presence and rendering checks are solid  
- ✔️ Interaction behaviors (e.g., typing, clicking, selecting) are well-tested  
- ✔️ Props with default/invalid values are handled in tests  

> **Suggestion:** For advanced coverage, you might later test error boundaries or simulate bad props using mocks.

---

#### 2. React Component Design  
- 🧼 Your components show good **defensive programming** — adding checks for `task`, `field`, and other possibly undefined props.  
- 🧠 Logic is mostly compartmentalized well (e.g., `TaskTable` cleanly delegates to subcomponents).  

> **Suggestions:**  
> - Consider making `task.id` a required prop in `NameInput`, `TimeInput`, etc. to enforce consistency (using PropTypes or TS if you adopt that later).  
> - As the app grows, splitting out memoized calculations (like `calcSum`) into separate utilities may help reduce component load.

---

#### 3. Edge Case Handling  
👍 Good catch on:  
- Using default fallbacks in inputs (`typeof task?.name === "string"` etc.)  
- Making dropdowns map dynamically from props (`CategorySelector`)  

---

#### 4. GIF and Visuals Section  
- **Visuals are clear and helpful.**  
- Including a GIF sets your PR apart and makes it more accessible for teammates or potential employers.  

✅ **Keep this up** for all UI-related PRs!

### 📌 Suggested Next Steps

- [x] Consider: Add test coverage badges or setup coverage reporting (e.g., using `vitest --coverage`)
     - Comments: Will download and run but won't make too many modifications based on results
- [x] (Optional) Consider: Add PropTypes or migrate to TypeScript for stricter props checking
     - Comments: Won't do this for now, might revisit later
- [x] Consider expanding snapshot testing to cover additional components beyond those currently tested (e.g., for full UI stability)
     - Comments: Will add snapshot tests to CustomFooter.jsx, CategorySelector.jsx, and TaskTable.jsx components
- [x] Merge the PR! 🎉
     - Comments: Completed
