# 🧾 Overview
This PR focuses on improving the project’s demonstrability and reliability by adding full end-to-end (E2E) testing, a new demo mode, and updated documentation. Automated Playwright tests now validate key user flows from task entry to statistics rendering, ensuring stable frontend-backend communication and accurate visual feedback. The demo mode introduces static mock data and simplified API routes, enabling the app to run offline for easier showcasing. Additionally, the README and project management documents (Requirement Specifications, Design Specifications, and others) were updated to better reflect the current system and enhance presentation readiness.

## 🔗 Context
This covers the following backlog items:
- `Presentation Readiness`: Added full README with setup, demo, and testing instructions; introduced demo mode for offline showcasing; updated diagrams and project docs for consistency.
- `End-to-End Testing`: Implemented Playwright tests for core flows (stats load, task entry, footer sum, submit); added test launcher and config for automated E2E validation.

---

## 🧪 Testing

All components were tested using:

- **Testing Framework**: Playwright 

### 🔍 Coverage includes:
- System: Cold Launch Test - Confirms the app loads successfully, displays the PlanGauge header, and transitions from “Unknown/Error” to loaded stats once /api/db/stats responds.
- System: Stats Retrieval Test - Verifies per-day totals, overall summary color, and footer SUM values match expected fixtures after successful stats loading.
- System: Error Handling Test - Simulates /stats failure (timeout/500) to confirm proper error state rendering and recovery behavior after reload.
- System: Category & Date Input Test - Ensures category dropdown updates the task color and date picker closes after selecting a date.
- System: Submit Flow Test - Intercepts POST requests to verify a single submission per click burst, with success toast confirmation and duplicate-click prevention.

## 🎥 Visuals
### Running E2E Tests

_Description:_ Shows how to run Playwright end-to-end tests by navigating to the frontend folder, running `npm run e2e`, and using the Playwright UI to visually execute tests like plan submission and stats loading.

### Running Demo Mode

_Description:_ Runs `npm run start:demo` to launch a simplified version of PlanGauge with a dummy Flask route and no external connections, enabling safe testing of UI interactions like task entry, color updates, and toast feedback.

## 📂 Branch Info
- **Base branch**: `main`
- **Feature branch**: `e2e_test`

This merges the completed end-to-end testing framework, demo mode, and updated documentation into the main branch. These changes make the project fully demonstrable and verifiable, with Playwright tests ensuring stable functionality and a comprehensive README supporting independent setup and evaluation. This brings the project to a polished, self-contained finishing point.

# 📋 ChatGPT PR Review – End-to-End Testing & Demo Mode Integration

E2E coverage and demo mode setup represent a strong progression in PlanGauge’s testing maturity. The PR demonstrates a working orchestration flow between Vite preview, Flask test server, and Playwright specs — a meaningful milestone that validates your full-stack interactions visually and logically. The demo mode integration is lightweight and safe for presentation use. Excellent clarity in the PR description and supporting GIFs.

---

## 🧪 Test Coverage

**What’s good**
- Solid coverage of core user flows (cold launch, stats retrieval, submission).
- Mock routes isolate backend dependencies cleanly.
- Verified toast feedback and UI response.
- Uses helper functions (`populateTable`, `stubPost`) to keep specs readable.

**Gaps / high-leverage adds**
1. **Footer SUM / Edit stability**
   - Add a rapid multi-edit test to ensure totals stay consistent under quick changes.
2. **Demo mode smoke test**
   - Launch via `npm run start:demo` and verify demo toasts + mock stats render.
3. **Submit logic unit coverage**
   - Extract POST deduplication guard into a small utility and unit-test it.
4. **Stats retry recovery**
   - Test failure state recovery (mock 500 → reload → success).
5. **Network cleanup**
   - Confirm routes are unregistered at test teardown to prevent “test ended” warnings.

---

## 🧱 Component / Logic Design

- **Excellent modular helpers** for network stubbing and table population.
- **Demo mode** correctly scoped — uses dummy Flask route, no Supabase/Notion calls.
- **Clear separation** between Playwright orchestration and UI logic.
- **Potential improvement:** Move submission dedup logic out of E2E-only layer for direct testing.

---

## ⏱️ Pacing of Work

- Sequential and focused progression: harness → spec helpers → E2E cases.
- Smart reuse of existing utilities; minimal redundant setup.
- Strong iteration rhythm visible through commits and test evolution.

---

## 🚧 Scope Creep Analysis

- Scope held tight: testing + demo readiness only.
- “Extras” (boot script cleanup, README updates, fixtures) directly support the goal.
- No unplanned features or schema changes introduced.

---

## 🧠 Overall Quality — Score

**8.7 / 10**

**Why:**  
Cohesive E2E suite with reusable helpers and isolated demo mode. Points off only for missing stress-tests (editing, retries) and lack of small-unit verification on deduplication logic.

---

## ✅ Recommended Next Steps

- Add **demo-mode E2E smoke test** to validate mock route + UI feedback.  
- Unit-test **submit dedup guard** in isolation.  
- Include **footer-sum edit test** for regression safety.  
- Ensure **route cleanup** in teardown to silence residual async warnings.  
- Keep upcoming PRs focused (≤ 800 LOC) and group docs/tests logically.
